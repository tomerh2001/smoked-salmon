# 🐟 smoked-salmon  

A simple tool to take the work out of uploading on Gazelle-based trackers. It generates spectrals, gathers metadata, allows re-tagging/renaming files, and automates the upload process.

This repository is Tomer's actively maintained fork of `smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon`. Use this README for the fork-specific policy, integration-branch rules, and release/distro differences. Use upstream docs for the inherited base feature set.

## 🌟 Features

This section documents the fork-only value on `master`: what this fork currently has that upstream does not.

- Optional AI metadata review workflow from [PR #342](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/342).
- Upload CLI automation flags and source-url helpers from [PR #345](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/345).
- Bandcamp parsing fixes for catno-prefixed and label-hosted releases from [PR #347](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/347).
- `open.qobuz.com` URL handling from [PR #352](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/352).
- RED cookie-backed upload hardening from [PR #362](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/362).
- Fork-specific release/distribution behavior:
  - release CI/CD on fork `master`
  - rolling Docker tags `personal-fork` and `alpha`
  - immutable releases in the form `X.Y.Z-personal-fork.N`
  - fork images report their own `X.Y.Z-personal-fork.N` runtime version inside Salmon

## 🔢 Fork Release Versioning

Fork `master` treats the version in `pyproject.toml` as the synced upstream base version, not as the final fork release version.

The release workflow reads `.github/fork-versioning.toml` and publishes the next semver after that upstream base:

- `release_bump = "patch"` when the fork-only delta is bugfix-only. Example: upstream `0.10.1` becomes fork `0.10.2-personal-fork.N`.
- `release_bump = "minor"` when the fork still carries any fork-only feature. Example: upstream `0.10.1` becomes fork `0.11.0-personal-fork.N`.
- After upstream advances, the same rule is applied again from the new synced base. Example: upstream `0.10.2` with a bugfix-only fork delta becomes `0.10.3-personal-fork.N`.

Keep `.github/fork-versioning.toml` aligned with the current fork-only delta whenever the carried patch set changes.

The release calculation lives in the repo-root helper [fork_versioning.py](fork_versioning.py) so GitHub Actions can compute release metadata before project dependencies are installed.

## 🧩 Fork Master Composition

This fork's `master` branch is an integration branch. It is intentionally built from `smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon` `master` plus the in-flight patch sets below so there is one branch that always reflects the combined state I run locally.

It is not meant to be reviewed upstream as one giant PR. The upstream review units are the smaller PRs listed here.

Fork-only commits on `master`:

- release CI/CD for the fork `master` branch
- rolling Docker tags `personal-fork` and `alpha`
- immutable fork releases in the form `X.Y.Z-personal-fork.N`
- fork-specific README and integration-branch policy
- fork images report their own `X.Y.Z-personal-fork.N` runtime version inside Salmon

How new work enters fork `master`:

This is the mandatory workflow for any change that lands on this fork. It is the canonical policy for `master`. Do not skip steps, do not change the order, and do not shortcut around it.

Every fork-changing task must follow this exact sequence:

1. Create a new issue on the upstream repository for the bug or feature.
2. Branch from upstream `smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon` `master`, not from this fork's `master`.
3. Implement the fix on that upstream-based branch and open a focused upstream PR.
4. Merge that PR branch into this fork's `master` so the integration branch stays ahead with the combined local state.
5. Let the fork `master` CI/CD publish a new release and refresh the rolling Docker tags.
6. Let local consumers use the new fork release artifacts instead of relying on an editable local checkout.

If you only want the AI work without the rest of the integration branch, use [PR #342](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/342).
